Introduction:
This project is a dynamic web page that utilizes "vanilla" JavaScript to create a shopping experience for users to browse and purchase items 
from three different categories: 'bank', 'jobs' and 'laptops'. The main focus of the project is to work with HTML structure, accessing DOM elements, 
retrieving data from an API, working with event listeners, adding items to the cart, and working with user input and CSS styling.

Setup and Running the Project:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The project should now be running and fully functional.

Features and Functionality:
Dynamic HTML structure that updates according to user input and API data.
Access to the DOM elements through JavaScript to manipulate the page in real-time.
Retrieval of data from an API to populate the page with relevant information.
Event listeners to handle user interactions and input, such as adding items to the cart.
CSS styling to enhance the overall user experience.

Usage Instructions:
